## About Me

I'm a rare hybrid — a **Doctor of Pharmacy** who went back to earn a **Master of Computer Science** (concentration: Data Mining & Intelligent Systems) because I believe the biggest unsolved problems in healthcare live at the intersection of clinical knowledge and modern AI.

By day, I lead pharmacy data analytics and innovation at a major health system. By night (and weekends), I build things, break things, and learn relentlessly.

- 🏥 **Healthcare AI** — applying LLMs, predictive models, and data engineering to real clinical and operational problems
- 🛠️ **Builder mindset** — if a manual process exists, I'm already thinking about how to automate it
- 🌍 **Solving local problems** — if I have a problem, someone else probably does too; that's worth building for
- 📚 **Perpetual student** — MCS, Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, Udacity Full Stack & Data Engineering nanodegrees... still going

## What I'm Working On

- 🤖 **Applying AI/ML to pharmacy & healthcare operations** — predictive models, NLP on clinical text, LLM-powered workflows
- 🧱 **Building personal projects** — developing real-world tools to sharpen my software engineering depth
- 🌱 **Exploring local problems worth solving** — finding pain points in my community and industry that code can fix
- 📖 **Deepening my ML/AI engineering foundations** — transformers, MLOps, agentic AI patterns
